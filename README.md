## Installation

```bash
npm install @stdlib/iter-counter
```

</section>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var iterCounter = require( '@stdlib/iter-counter' );
```

#### iterCounter( iterator )

Returns an [iterator][mdn-iterator-protocol] which iteratively computes the number of [iterated][mdn-iterator-protocol] values (i.e., the cumulative count).

```javascript
var array2iterator = require( '@stdlib/array-to-iterator' );

var it = iterCounter( array2iterator( [ 10, 20, 30, 40 ] ) );
// returns <Object>

var v = it.next().value;
// returns 1

v = it.next().value;
// returns 2

v = it.next().value;
// returns 3

// ...
```

The returned [iterator][mdn-iterator-protocol] protocol-compliant object has the following properties:

-   **next**: function which returns an [iterator][mdn-iterator-protocol] protocol-compliant object containing the next iterated value (if one exists) assigned to a `value` property and a `done` property having a `boolean` value indicating whether the [iterator][mdn-iterator-protocol] is finished.
-   **return**: function which closes an [iterator][mdn-iterator-protocol] and returns a single (optional) argument in an [iterator][mdn-iterator-protocol] protocol-compliant object.

## Notes

-   If an environment supports `Symbol.iterator` **and** a provided [iterator][mdn-iterator-protocol] is iterable, the returned [iterator][mdn-iterator-protocol] is iterable.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var randu = require( '@stdlib/random-iter-randu' );
var iterCounter = require( '@stdlib/iter-counter' );

// Create a seeded iterator for generating pseudorandom numbers:
var rand = randu({
    'seed': 1234,
    'iter': 10
});

// Create an iterator which iteratively computes the number of iterated values:
var it = iterCounter( rand );

// Perform manual iteration...
var v;
while ( true ) {
    v = it.next();
    if ( v.done ) {
        break;
    }
    console.log( v.value );
}
```
